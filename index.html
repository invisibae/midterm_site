<h3>Billions more everyday items are set to be connected to the internet in
the next few years,</h3>
<p>especially as chips get cheaper and cheaper to produce
-- and crucially, small enough to fit into even the smallest product.</p>
<p>Potentially, any standard household item could become connected to the
internet, even if there's no reason for the manufacturers to do so.</p>
<p>Eventually that processors needed to power an IoT device will become
effectively free, making it possible to turn anything into a internet-
enabled device.</p>
<p>"The price of turning a dumb device into a smart device will be 10 cents,"
says Mikko HyppÃ¶nen, chief research officer at F-Secure.</p>
<p>However, it's unlikely that consumer will be the one who gains the biggest
benefits from every device their homes collecting data; it's those who
build them who will reap the greatest rewards -- alongside government
surveillance services.</p>
<p>"It's going to be so cheap that vendors will put the chip in any device,
even if the benefits are only very small. But those benefits won't be
benefits to you, the consumer, they'll be benefits for the manufacturers
because they want to collect analytics," says HyppÃ¶nen, speaking at Cloud
Expo Europe.</p>
<p>For example, a kitchen appliance manufacturer might collect data and use
it for everything from seeing how often the product breaks to working out
where customers live and altering their advertising accordingly in an
effort to boost sales -- and the user might not even know this is
happening, if devices have their own 5G connection and wouldn't even need
access to a home Wi-Fi network.</p>
<p>"The IoT devices of the future won't go online to benefit you -- you won't
even know that it's an IoT device," says HyppÃ¶nen.</p>

  <h3>What is the Internet of Things?</h3>
  <iframe class=" large-12 medium-12 small-12" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_AlcRoqS65E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>This talk by Benson Hougland at TEDx Temecula is a good place to start</p>
</div>

<p>"And you won't be able to avoid this, you won't be able to buy devices
which aren't IoT devices, you won't be able to restrict access to the
internet because they won't be going online through your Wi-Fi. We can't
avoid it, it's going to happen."</p>
<p>Indeed, it's already started, with devices you wouldn't expect to need an
internet connection -- including children's toys -- being discovered to
have gaping cybersecurity vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>These scenarios, says Darren Thomson, CTO & vice president of technology
services at Symantec, are occurring because those in the technology
industry are thinking about whether they could connect things to the
internet, but aren't thinking about whether they should.</p>
<p>"Could I attach my dog to the internet? Could I automate the process of
ordering a taxi on my mobile phone? We're obsessed with could we problems.
That's how we live our lives and careers, we invent things and we solve
problems. We're good at 'Could we'," he said, also speaking at Cloud Expo
Europe.</p>

  <h3>Where To Find IOT Devices</h3>

<p>No matter the reason why things are being connected to the internet,
Thomson agrees with HyppÃ¶nen about what the end goal is: data collection</p>
<p>"The connectivity of those devices is impressive and important. But what's
more important is how that's coming to bare across various markets. Every
single sector on the planet is in a race to digitise, to connect things.
And very importantly, to collect data from those things," he says.</p>

<p>However, various incidents have demonstrated how the Internet of Things is
ripe with security vulnerabilities as vendors put profit and speed to
market before anything else, with cybersecurity very low down the list of
priorities.</p>
<p>Retrofitting updates via the use of patches might work for a PC, a laptop
or even a smartphone, but there are huge swathes of devices -- and even
whole internet-connected industrial or urban facilities -- for which being
shutdown in order to install and update is impossible.</p>
<p>"The security industry to date is predicated on the benefit of the
retrofit. IT has designed insecure systems then we've secured them. That's
kind of OK in a world where a device can have some downtime," says
Thomson.</p>
<p>"But a car, a building, a city, a pipeline, a nuclear power facility can't
tolerate downtime. So if we don't build security and privacy in to our
designs from the very first whiteboard, we're going to leave ourselves
with a problem."</p>
<p>Not only that, but as IoT devices become more and more common, people will
start to ignore them</p>
<p>"The reality of the human mind is as we embed things, we tend to forget
about them, we get complacent about them. Many of you are probably wearing
a smart device on your wrist to monitor your behaviour and exercise
routines. But no doubt two weeks after you started wearing it, you forgot
it was there," he says.</p>

  <p>IOT Devices, like this smart speaker, are becoming more and more common in homes across the world</p>

<br>
<p>"The danger from a psychological perspective is that people forget about
that technology and forget about the risks associated with it and our own
personal mitigation of that risk."</p>
<p>Even now, consumers are too blasÃ© about connected devices, keen to jump
on the latest technological trends failing to realise the associated
security risks. Then even if they do, they remain unclear on how to secure
the IoT devices -- that is, if there is the option of securing it in the
first place.</p>
<p>"Nobody reads the manual, especially to page 85 where it says how to
change the default credentials, or page 90 where it says how to set up
user accounts and restrict access to the admin interface, or page 100
where it says how to segment your network," says HyppÃ¶nen.</p>
<p>He likens it to the "exact same problem we had in the 80s" when people
wouldn't even bother to set a time on their video recorder as it involved
picking up the manual, so it'd end up always flashing 12:00.</p>
<p>It's therefore important for the Internet of Things cybersecurity
loopholes to be shut sooner rather than later so as to avoid nightmare
scenarios where hackers could exploit vulnerabilities to attack anything
from pacemakers and other medical devices, to connected cars to even
entire industrial facilities.</p>
<p>But are IoT device manufacturers going to do this anytime soon? Probably
not.</p>

<p>"The manufacturers of IoT devices are unlikely to fix this by themselves.
They're unlikely to start investing more money in their IoT devices for
security because money is the most important thing in home appliances,"
says HyppÃ¶nen</p>
<p>"When you buy a washing machine, price is the most important selling
point. Nobody's asking, 'does it have a firewall or intrusion prevention
systems?' Cybersecurity isn't a selling point for a washing machine, so
why would manufacturers invest money in it?" he adds.</p>
<p>It might eventually be regulation which has to fix this problem; as
HyppÃ¶nen points out, device safety is already regulated. "When you buy a
washing machine, it must not short circuit and catch fire, we regulate
that. Maybe we should regulate security," he says.</p>
